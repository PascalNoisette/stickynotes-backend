Dear StickyNotes Users,

I'm happy to introduce new iOS App!

https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/sticky-notes-put-a-sticky-on-your-web/id992415126?l=en&mt=8n

You can view and create stickies.
And sync stickies between your iphone and desktop via this app!
Please check it out.

Currently, some features in ios app needs in-app purchases
in order to run sync-server and develop and maintenance continuously.
I would be glad if you support this app.

If you have any questions or comments, just let me know with:
